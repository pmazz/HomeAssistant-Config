This repository contains my personal [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) configuration and documentation.  
Feel free to :star: it if you find it somehow interesting or inspiring!

Btw the repo is automagically committed by an [Azure Pipeline](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines), triggered after each push to my [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops) private repo, which takes care of applying some privacy adjustments before committing. :v:
